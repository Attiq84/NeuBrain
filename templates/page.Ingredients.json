Clinical trials have found that after consuming Reishi, patients with neurasthenia – a condition often associated with depression, anxiety, or emotional stress – found a significant reduction in fatigue and an improvement in overall wellbeing. Research suggests that the polysaccharides and triterpenoid enzymes in the mushroom are responsible for its stress-lowering capacity. Additional clinical research has suggested Reishi can reduce sleep onset latency (SOL) and increase the time spent in restful sleep. <\/p><p><strong>Benefits: <\/strong>The results of multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled studies link Reishi to anxiety- and stress-reducing properties. In one such study, 123 patients experiencing neurasthenia were provided Reishi for a period of eight weeks. After the trial period, the overall sense of well-being among patients increased from 15.5% to 38.7%. In a second study, 48 breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy showed significant improvements in the domains of physical well-being and fatigue subscale after treatment with the mushroom. These patients reported less anxiety and depression and a better quality of life.  <\/p>","image-main":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_1_0eb94bf7-2406-4585-91ec-13aaaba16334.svg","image-main1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/left_rishi.svg","question1":"Citations","answer1":"<ul><li>Zhao, Hong, et al. “Spore Powder of<em>Ganoderma Lucidum<\/em>Improves Cancer-Related Fatigue in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Endocrine Therapy: A Pilot Clinical Trial.” <em>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine<\/em>, vol. 2012, 2012, pp. 1–8., <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1155\/2012\/809614\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1155\/2012\/809614<\/span><\/a>. <\/li><li>Tang, Wenbo, et al. “A Randomized, Double-Blind and Placebo-Controlled Study of a<em>Ganoderma Lucidum<\/em>Polysaccharide Extract in Neurasthenia.” <em>Journal of Medicinal Food<\/em>, vol. 8, no. 1, 2005, pp. 53–58., <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/jmf.2005.8.53\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/jmf.2005.8.53<\/span><\/a>. <\/li><li>Cui, Xiang-Yu, et al. “Extract of Ganoderma Lucidum Prolongs Sleep Time in Rats.” <em>Journal of Ethnopharmacology<\/em>, vol. 139, no. 3, 2012, pp. 796–800., <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jep.2011.12.020\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jep.2011.12.020<\/span><\/a>. <\/li><li>Chu, Qing-Ping, et al. “Extract of Ganoderma Lucidum Potentiates Pentobarbital-Induced Sleep via a GABAergic Mechanism.” <em>Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior<\/em>, vol. 86, no. 4, 2007, pp. 693–698., <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pbb.2007.02.015\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pbb.2007.02.015<\/span><\/a>. <\/li><li>Cör, Darija, et al. “Antitumour, Antimicrobial, Antioxidant and Antiacetylcholinesterase Effect of Ganoderma Lucidum Terpenoids and Polysaccharides: A Review.” <em>Molecules<\/em>, vol. 23, no. 3, 2018, p. 649., <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/molecules23030649\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/molecules23030649<\/span><\/a>. <\/li><\/ul>"}},"63bd947b-8912-4ef8-aebd-01e1401f3f07":{"type":"slide","settings":{"question":"Turkey Tail Mushroom","subtitle":"","title":"<span class=\"bg-te\">Turkey Tail Mushroom<\/span>","text":"<p>Our Turkey Tail delivers prebiotics such as indigestible fibers and polysaccharides to positively regulate the balance of intestinal flora, improving gut health and digestion.*<\/p><p>Double Extracted, 100% Fruiting Body.<\/p>","image-1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2_3258b862-18f3-4362-bc2c-635fe70d7fc3.svg","image-2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3_43d53920-257b-47a0-8883-e6b399fb2d95.svg","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/turk.jpg","focal_point":"center","layout":"left","height":550,"framed":true,"parallax":true,"answer":"<p><strong>Turkey Tail was found to support the metabolic process, resulting in better absorption of foods and energy.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Bioactivities: <\/strong>Turkey Tail has been linked to improving gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria that support healthy digestion.
